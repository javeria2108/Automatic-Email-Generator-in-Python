# Automatic-Email-Generator-in-Python
This project intends to aid in sending a single email to a large number of people with their names. Just create a contacts.txt file with the names and emails of all the recipients and edit the sender email address in this code to your email address.
As of May 2022, Google has removed less secure apps access, so you need to use an apps password to give access to your email to smtp lib.
